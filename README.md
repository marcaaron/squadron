# Squadron
## Phaser 3 App

This is an attempt to recreate elements of the SNES shmup game U.N. Squadron. My hope is that it will eventually turn into some kind of Phaser 3 tutorial/article.

The project utilizes Webpack and ES6 modules to help separate game elements and functions.

To test out my progress clone the repo, `yarn install`, and `yarn start`. Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
